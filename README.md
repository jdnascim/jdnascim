👋 Hi there, I am José Nascimento!

🚀 I am an AI Specialist with a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Universidade de Campinas, Brazil.

🔭 My doctoral research, conducted under the DejáVù Project and advised by Prof. Anderson Rocha at the Artificial Intelligence (Recod.ai) lab, focused on developing AI methods to identify whether social media content is connected to specific forensic events. Today, I leverage this expertise to design and apply AI solutions that address real-world challenges.
